/**
 * Math utilities library.
 *
 * Provides general utilities to support 2D and 3D graphics capabilities of {@link WebViewer|Viewers}.
 *
 * Also provides specialized graphics utilities, grouped in the following namespaces:
 *
 * * **boundaries** - Utility functions for working with 3D and 2D boundaries.
 * * **compression** - Utility functions for geometry and coordinate de/compression.
 * * **curves** - Utility functions for working with spline curves.
 * * **geometry** - Utility functions for generating geometry.
 * * **rays** - Utility functions for working with 3D rays.
 * * **rtc** - Utility functions for working with relative-to-center (RTC) coordinates.
 *
 * ### Usage Example
 *
 * ````javascript
 * import {WebViewer, math} from "xeokit-viewer.modern.js";
 * const viewer = new WebViewer();
 * //...
 * const aabb = math.boundaries.AABB();
 * math.boundaries.collapseAABB3(aabb);
 * math.boundaries.expandAABB3(viewer.scene.aabb);
