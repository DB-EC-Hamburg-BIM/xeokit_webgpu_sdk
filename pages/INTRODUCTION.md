# Introduction

The xeokit SDK is a software development kit that provides tools and libraries for creating high-quality 3D web 
applications and visualizations. It is designed to work with modern web technologies such as WebGL, HTML5, and 
JavaScript to enable developers to create interactive 3D models and scenes that can be rendered in real-time in web browsers.

The following are some of the key features of the Xeokit SDK:

* 3D Geometry Processing: Xeokit provides a set of tools for processing 3D geometry, including support for complex 
meshes, materials, and textures. This allows developers to create highly-detailed and realistic 3D models.

* Lighting and Shading Effects: Xeokit provides advanced lighting and shading effects that enable developers to create highly-realistic lighting environments. This includes support for global illumination, shadows, reflections, and more.

* Material and Texture Mapping: Xeokit provides a range of material and texture mapping options, allowing developers to create highly-detailed and realistic 3D models with accurate surface properties and textures.

Customization: Xeokit is highly customizable, enabling developers to tailor their 3D applications to meet their specific needs. This includes support for custom shaders, custom materials, custom textures, and more.

Compatibility: Xeokit is designed to be compatible with a wide range of web technologies, including WebGL, HTML5, and JavaScript. This makes it accessible to a large number of developers with different skill sets.

Integration: Xeokit can be easily integrated with other web technologies, such as popular web frameworks like Angular and React, making it easy to incorporate 3D elements into existing web applications.

Performance: Xeokit is designed for high-performance 3D rendering in web browsers, with efficient memory management and optimized rendering algorithms.

Overall, the Xeokit SDK is a powerful and flexible tool for building 3D web applications and visualizations. It provides a range of advanced features for creating highly-realistic and interactive 3D scenes, and is highly customizable and compatible with a range of web technologies.
